    <p><b> Favorite Assignments this Semester:</b></p>
    <br> Midterm: Where we used python to edit images by flipping horizontally, making grayscale, and filter out obtrusive objects
    <br>Final: Where we had a lot of autonomy to build our own website with multiple pages, images, and hyperlinks
